#  the binarization is simple,just let the threshold 220
   so there isn't a function to do it
#  MY_Hough function's return values are different from the 
   hough functions in Matlab
#  MY_Edge function is wroten by myself, taking the canny function
   in Matlab as reference
#  MY_Gaussian function is just a 3x3 gaussian core, according to 
   the sapce distance to distribute the coefficient
